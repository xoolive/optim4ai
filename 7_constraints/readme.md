# Constraint programming

**Constraint Programming** (CP) is a powerful framework for problem satisfaction and optimisation. As with similar formalisms like _Linear Programming_, the key skill consists in expressing a problem in such a way that efficient algorithms may be implemented.

Notebook sessions can be run on:

- the computer in the classroom. Activate the environment before running Jupyter lab:

  ```bash
  # The following commands only work in the classroom
  module load python/3.7
  source activate ~x.olive/students
  ```

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/xoolive/optim4ai/) is a good fallback option, but data files must be uploaded, and solutions to exercices must be checked separately from the [Github folder](https://github.com/xoolive/optim4ai/tree/master/2_gradient/solutions).

- your own computer:

  - Linux, Mac OS (>= 10.15): just install the `facile` library;
  - Windows: you must run [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and follow the Linux instructions.
    If this sounds all Greek to you, you must fall back to another option.
