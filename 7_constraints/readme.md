Notebook sessions can be run on:

- the computer in the classroom. Activate the environment before running Jupyter lab:

  ```bash
  # The following commands only work in the classroom
  module load python/3.7
  source activate ~x.olive/students
  ```

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/xoolive/optim4ai/) is a good fallback option, but data files must be uploaded, and solutions to exercices must be checked separately from the [Github folder](https://github.com/xoolive/optim4ai/tree/master/2_gradient/solutions).

- your own computer:

  - Linux, Mac OS (>= 10.15): just install the `facile` library;
  - Windows: you must run [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and follow the Linux instructions.
    If this sounds all Greek to you, you must fall back to another option.

## Projects

Projects should be run as Python scripts from Visual Studio Code.

Open the workspace file (with the WSL connector for Windows users), then access the project folder.

Details about projects are presented on this [page](/constraints/problems).
