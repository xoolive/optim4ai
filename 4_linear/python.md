# Solving LP problems with Python

[« Previous](.) \| [Up ↑](.) \| [Next »](./duality)

This section will require a Python environment with, either:

- the [PuLP library](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/), with the default open-source solver CBC. This solver falls behind its commercial counterparts but is sufficient for demonstration purposes within this course;
- the [IBM Decision Optimization CPLEX Modeling `docplex`](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc/) for Python. You are entitled to an academic license for education purposes if you register online. **Commercial use is prohibited**.
- the [Gurobi Python interface](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/quickstart_windows/cs_python.html). You are entitled to an academic license for education purposes if you register online. **Commercial use is prohibited**.
