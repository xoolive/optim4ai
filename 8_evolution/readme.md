# Evolutionary methods

[« Previous](../7_constraints) \| [Home ↑](../) \| [Next »](../9_further)

**Evolutionary methods** become of interest when exact methods reach their limits because of combinatorial of the problem running out of control; functions to optimise behaving as black boxes, with noisy output; or functions with complex shapes and difficulty to run out of local minima.

The premise of evolutionary computation is simple: the simulation of natural selection used to solve a problem, where candidate solutions compete as individuals in order to inﬂuence future generations. From this simple premise, a multitude of algorithms have been developed, and evolutionary computation can be found in a number of domains.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Disclaimer</b><br/>
At this point of the course, as many of such methods are more of <em>metaheuristics</em>, general approaches to optimisation where much is left to code, we do not provide any notebook but leave the reader with the freedom to choose their most appropriate tool.
