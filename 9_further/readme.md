We are constrained by time in this course, and there is a lot more to learn about in terms of optimisation methods. This page lists many references to important keywords in this field.

## Gradient descent methods

- Learn how to solve quadratic problems with SLSQP;
- Learn about quasi-Newton methods for fast gradient converging methods like BFGS;
- Learn about constrained optimisation with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem.

## Linear programming

- Learn about interior-point methods
- Learn about the duality theorem
